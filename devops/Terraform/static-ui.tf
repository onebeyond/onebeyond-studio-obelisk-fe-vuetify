# There are 2 options to deploy custom domain:
# 1. Using TXT and CNAME records (implemented here). The below binding gets created in pending state
#    and waiting for a validation via the produced token and TXT record. After the binding is created
#    copy the token from Azure Portal and ask a person responsible for managing DNS records to create
#    both the TXT record with the token and the CNAME record for proper name resolution. The pros of this method
#    is that it does not require you to wait till all those records exist before you can complete the
#    deployment scripts.
# 2. Ask a person responsible for managing DNS records to create just a CNAME record, wait till it gets propagated
#    and use 'cname-delegation' for the validation_type. The deployment will succeed only when the CNAME
#    record propagation fully completes.
# Provided you are responsible for managing DNS records, you can automate it even further:
# 1. Via using Azure managed DNS records
# 2. Via a bunch of providers capable to deal with DNS records:
